####Description

[Zlatan Ibrahimovic](http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1851637-zlatan-ibrahimovic-calls-himself-god-ahead-of-world-cup-qualifier) is one of the most entertaining football players of our generation. Beyond his amazing playing ability, his hubris and endlessly hilarious quotes always entertain. 

This is a silly basic Ruby program I wrote that displays random Zlatan quotes around two different themes, playing quotes and beauty (or hubris) quotes.
